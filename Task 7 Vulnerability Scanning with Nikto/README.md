# Task 7 -Vulnerability Scanning with Nikto

🎯 Objective
The objective of this task was to perform a vulnerability scan on a target web server using **Nikto**, identify potential security issues, and analyze the results.
This task demonstrates basic web vulnerability assessment techniques.

# Tools Used
- Nikto v2.5.0
- Kali Linux (VirtualBox VM)
- Apache2 Web Server
- Local Target IP: 192.168.*.*
- Port: 80

# Steps Performed

1. Installed Nikto
   Nikto was installed on Kali using:
   sudo apt install nikto
   
2. Verified Target Server
   Checked the Apache2 service status:
   sudo systemctl status apache2

   Initially, the service was **inactive (dead)** and **disabled**.
   
   Started Apache manually:
   sudo systemctl start apache2
   After starting, the server successfully responded to requests on port **80**.

3. Ran Nikto Scan on the Target
   Executed the vulnerability scan with:
   nikto -h 192.168.0.104
   Nikto scanned the Apache web server running on the localmachine. The scan detected various issues and informational findings.

# Key Findings

1. **Missing Security Headers**
   - **X-Frame-Options header is not present**
      - Risk: Vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.
      - Reference: MDN (X-Frame-Options)
   - **X-Content-Type-Options header is not set**
      - Risk: Browser may interpret files as a different MIME type, enabling content-type spoofing.
      - Reference: Netsparker (Missing Content-Type Header)
        
2. **ETag Information Leakage**
   - Apache server leaks **inode, size, and mtime** values via ETag header.
   - This may help an attacker enumerates files or infer server **metadata**.
   - Refernce: **CVE-2003-1418**
     
3. **Potentially Excessive Allowed HTTP Methods**
   - Allowed methods: **GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD**
   - While not dangerous alone, exposing unnecessary methods increases attack surface.

4. **Sensitive Endpoint Exposed**
   - /server-status is publicly acccessible.
   - This page reveals server configurationand performance details.
   - Should be **restricted to localhost or internal IP**.
   - Reference: **OSVDB-561**

# Conclusion

The Nikto scan successfully identified several misconfigurations and security issues on the Apache server, including:
- Missing security headers
- Information disclosure
- Exposed server-status page
  These findings highlight the importance of securing HTTP headers, restricting sensitive endpoints, and properly configuring the Apache
  server to reduce attack surface.
